### Puffers, a Sample Character for Strays

>  This  character  follow  the  Character Creation  rules  from  Fate
>  Accelerated, including the specific things from [Strays][1].

Puffers was in the past one  of the biggest, meanest, stinkiest skunks
all around the world. But that was not because he chose this: he never
had a choice,  being raised by Naughty skunks, living  like them until
his paw  was hurt by a  bear trap in  a florest in Gloucester  and his
pack left him behind  to die.  A very kind and big kid  (as big as his
heart) had  discovered him and take  him at home, treated  his paw and
cared for him.  The paw was almost  lost, as the bear  trap was rusted
and his paw  had badly inflamed, but thanks the  kid Puffers had cured
the wound.  Even  with the stink (that Puffers never  had been able to
suppress totally), the kid had not  left him behind, even bringing him
at the rugby  training as a mascot. Puffers helped  him, by making him
goes  to the  training  field (and  trying  to not  stink  him at  the
proccess) and fighting other Naughty  critters (like the squirrels and
moles that tried to mess up the rugby training field), and cheering by
the  rugby team  (they changed  its name  for _Gloucester  High School
Skunks_).

The kid grew  up to a very  strong and good guy,  a professional rugby
hooker with a  foot at the national  squad, and that came  the day for
both split apart. When the Old Nick came and take Puffers with him for
the  Farm, Puffers  had already  chosed to  be a  Nice guy  and redeem
himself from his past. However,  time and another something happens to
remember Puffers from  his mean past, showing him  the attonement path
is a hard one, although a satisfying one.

Puffers is the kind of _Old Master at Field_ character, that relies on
his wisdom and skills  and do things at the right  time. He also still
searches for repentance for the wrongs he did as a young critters, and
he's the  first one to give  a chance for those  Naughty critters that
could repent,  but at the same  time he's fierce (although  fair) into
fighting against those who still goes into bad ways.

### Aspects

| **Hig Concept:** | A very old, sage skunk                          |
| **Trouble:**     | The Old Times still haunts me                   |
|                  | _"Crouch, Touch, Pause, Engage!"_               |
|                  | *"The Humans had not left me behind"*           |
|                  | Everyone should have a second chance, as I had! |

+ _Careful:_ Fair (+2)

### Stunts  [Refresh: 3]

+ **The Skunk  Perfume:** Because I'm a _very smelly  skunk_ I receive
  +2 at _Cleverly Create Advantages_ using my stink

### Tangles

+ **It's all about smell:** I get  +1 while using my smelling sense to
  discerne things (like emotions and  discovering lies), but I take -1
  in all social rolls because I smell a little too bad
